			<p class="main">Silverthorn Dog Training Club was established in 1978 as an obedience club. We are a Kennel Club registered with four classes ranging from puppy to advanced. We believe in firm but fair, reward based training methods and do not allow the use of check chains, pinch or prong or shock collars or any punishment which causes pain or distress. We are a non-profit making committee run club, run for our members by our members. We like to make our members feel involved with the club as part of the community and we regularly fund raise for various dog charities. Our instructors are very experienced and will be there to help and advise whenever needed.
